Created and coded

- student-center.ejs
- faculty-center.ejs
- course-search.ejs
- settings.ejs
- search-script.js (Provides extra functionality to mobile users in course-search)
- user-functions.js (This includes all of the functions used by server.js)
- settings-script.js (Scrapped functionality for email modal)
- center-script.js (Allows modals to be opened and closed)

All of the mentioned ejs files are styled with

- css/user-styles.css

student-center.ejs and faculty-center are also styled with

- css/center-styles.css

course-search.ejs is also styled with

- css/course-styles.css

settings.ejs is also styled with

- css/settings-styles.css

For server.js:
- Using Passport, I created post functions for studentsignup and teachersignup that follows the User model that I altered to include an ID (generated by function, idGenerator), role, and full name as opposed to first and last name. Inside those functions, I made a search to the database to make sure that the email that the user uses is unique. I also hash the user's password to prevent hackers from stealing and using user accounts
- For login, I created passport-config.js and the function, ensureAuthenticated, to authenticate that the information given by the user matches what's inside the database. I also created the function, userRedirect, which redirects the user to the correct dashboard, depending on their role.
- For a majority of the ejs files, I created get functions that render the page and send information to the page, like the name of the user or a message.
- The post functions I made for faculty-center (/facultycenter) and student-center (/studentcenter) are similar where the value given by the drop-down lists determines the courses that will be returned to the user. 
  * For students, the returned courses will come from the enrollment schema that I created, unless the student chose the Notified Courses option where in that case, the returned courses will come from the notifications schema that I created.
  * Since a professor is responsible for creating a course, the course will be placed in the courses schema. That means, whenever a professor selects an option from the drop-down list, the given semester and name of the professor will search and return results from the courses schema.
  * Also, for both users, there are error messages that will be displayed to user, in case no courses are found in a specific schema.
- Both users can also delete courses that are specific to their schema.
  * A student can remove a course from their notified table which is directed to the post function, /removenotification. 
  * Students can also remove a course from their schedule. In this case, when a student leaves an enrolled course, the number of students enrolled in the course is reduced by 1 and the student's name is removed from the roster.
  * Professors can also remove any of the courses that they have created. In this case, when the course is removed, every student that is either notified or enrolled in the course is removed as well.
- For course search, whenever a student searches for a course, the search terms (Subject, Course Number, and Semester) will search the course schema and during the search, the last names of each instructor is placed inside an array which will be used when displaying information inside course-search.ejs
  * What's great about the search functionality is that a student can use all of the search fields, two of the search fields (Ex: Subject and semester) or one of them (Ex: Semester) and still get a result. This is because the coursename that the database uses to search the database is a regular expression, so this makes searching for courses easier.
- I included enrollment functionality for desktop and mobile users, which are linked to the same enrollment post function that searches for the selected course inside the course schema. However, before the course and student is saved in the enrollment table, the function checks if the student is already enrolled in the course, is enrolled in a similar course or if the course conflicts with one of the student's enrolled courses. Once those errors have been checked for, the amount of students enrolled in the course (studentsenrolled) gets increased by one and the student roster is updated.
- I also included notification functionality for desktop and mobile users where the post function is activated when the user clicks on the bell icon. The function searches the selected course inside the course schema before checking if the student is already notified for the course or if the student is already enrolled in the course.

## Design Differences (Jonathan Dinh)

- Login / Signup pages: The buttons that direct the user to the login and signup pages were changed to a navbar that extends across the whole page. This change was made for better readability and responsiveness, allowing for a cleaner way of displaying a hamburger menu in mobile devices.
- student-signup.html: A link to a new html file, teacher-signup was created to help with managing the database tables.
- teacher-signup.html: Created to help with managing the database tables on signup.
- signup-successful.html: Created as a way to tell users that they have successfully signed up. If the signup was not successful, an error will be thrown.
- login.html: The final design of the mobile login page includes the Queens College logo at the top left. The initial visual design took into account, the lack of space on the screen, which  led to the decision of removing the logo. However, after completing the code for this design, it was concluded that there was enough space for the logo to remain, ultimately improving the design.
- student-signup.html / teacher-signup.html: Similarly to the mobile design for the login page, the Queens College logo was kept in the sign up mobile design, straying from the initial visual designs.

## Design Differences (Anthony Lombardo)

- Student Center Page: This page in its current state is very similar to the initial design. However, there are changes in terms of the Class (or rather the Course) section of the design. Initially, the design used a grid, which explains the open spaces shown. I replaced the grid with a table, in order to not make the schedule appear awkward to users. Also, I added a dropdown list on the top right of the Course section to select between different semesters. I've also included an option (Notified Courses) that shows a table consisting of courses where the student clicked the notification bell on. This table works similarly to the enroll page on CUNYFirst. In the notified table and schedule, a student can unenroll or unnotify themselves for a specific class. This is achieved by clicking on the "Remove Course" or "Unnotify Me" button before verifying their choice. The last change I've made to the original design is removing the payment section, since it is not required to implement.
- Faculty Center Page: Much like the Student Center page, the current state is very similar to the initial design. Also, the changes to the design are very similar to the changes I've made to the Student Center design where I changed out a grid for a table, along with including a dropdown list and an info button that works similarly to the Student Center Page. The user can also remove a course that they created by clicking on the info button and clicking "Remove Course". Inside the info button, there is also a roster button that shows every student that's enrolled in the course along with their emails, in case the professor needs to get in contact with a specific student.
- Course Search Page: For the desktop and tablet design of the Course Search Page, I added a notification button where students can save a course for later and view the course in their notified courses table on the Student Center page. For the mobile design of the Course Search Page, I added the notification bell on the top right of the Select Class section, along with an availability status section that is located on the bottom left. This informs the students is the course that they selected in the dropdown list is available or not. Also, it should come as no surprise that I changed every instance of the word "class" with "course"
- Settings Page: For the Setting Page, the only changes I've made were removing the notification section for faculty users, removing the phone section for all users because the most popular package that can send text message notifications is a paid service, and removing the ability to change emails because this caused certain post functions (Mainly, enrollment) to ignore errors that should be triggered.
